# Troika QoL

A collection of quality of life "improvements" for the Troika Foundry VTT system.

## Improvements

- Adds "Apply Damage" and "Apply Healing" options to the context menu on chat cards that contain damage rolls (basically all rolls that aren't skill/luck rolls).
- Luck automatically rolls under, and it decrements itself
- There is a bed icon next to Luck that will roll 2d6 and automatically add it to your luck
- When you roll for a spell, the spell cost is automatically taken from your stamina
- On the Provisions tab, there are two icons next to the Provisions title
  - The bed restores 2d6 to your stamina (resting)
  - The cookie restores 1d6 to your stamina (eating provision)
