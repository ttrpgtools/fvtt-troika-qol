# Troika QoL

A 'potential' collection of quality of life improvements for the Troika Foundry VTT system.

I say potential as there is only one at the moment. More may follow.

## Improvements

- Adds "Apply Damage" and "Apply Healing" options to the context menu on chat cards that contain damage rolls (basically all rolls that aren't skill/luck rolls).
